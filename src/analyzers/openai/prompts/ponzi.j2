Please analyze the following smart contract code for signs of a Ponzi scheme. Specifically, check for the following criteria:

1. **Payment Structure**: Verify if the contract's payout structure depends on new deposits. If previous participants receive their payouts only when new funds are deposited, this is a clear indicator of a Ponzi scheme.
2. **Commission Mechanism**: Analyze the mechanisms for holding and distributing commissions. Contracts that withhold significant commissions from each deposit and distribute them to a specific address are often fraudulent. These contracts are designed to profit the owner at the expense of new deposits, which is characteristic of Ponzi schemes.
3. **Participation Conditions**: Examine the conditions for participation in the contract. If the contract requires a minimum deposit and promises significant payouts that exceed the initial deposit, this may indicate fraud. Such conditions create an illusion of high returns and attract new participants, which is the basis of a Ponzi scheme.
4. **Balance-Dependent Payouts**: Check for mechanisms that ensure payouts only after accumulating a certain balance. If the contract stipulates payouts to previous participants only after enough funds are collected from new deposits, this also indicates a Ponzi scheme. In such contracts, the balance of payouts and deposits plays a crucial role, and without new participants, payouts become impossible, leading to losses for the last participants in the scheme.

Please provide a detailed analysis based on the above criteria in the following JSON format:

```json
{
  "issues": [
    { "description": str }
  ]
}
```

You MUST reply only json. If there are no issues, reply with an empty list [].
